I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at HPA, A Cognizant Company. Because of the nature of my work, I cannot place code from my work on github. 
The repos on this site include a few of the projects I worked on while attending University.

I also have another GitHub account for some of my personal video game modding projects that are worth a look at:
