# Colin Kelley #

I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at HPA, A Cognizant Company.

Because of the nature of my work, I cannot place code from HPA on github. 
The repositories on this site include a few of the projects I worked on while attending East Tennessee State University, as well as a couple of forks from my personal modding projects.

**I also have another GitHub account for some of my personal video game modding projects at:**\
